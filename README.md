1. API KEY is protected by making a proxy for the main API
2. Caching
    -marweather.js
3. Rate limiting for spaming this proxy API
    -marweather2.js (+above)
4. Slow Down the response (which reduces the number of requests)
    -marweather3.js (+above)
5. Check API Keys (or can check the user logged in with different IP addresses) and limit the hits
    -marweather4.js (+above)
